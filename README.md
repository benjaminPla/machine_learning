# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

You have the output column and you train the model with it.

- **Classification**: Predict a class label or category (e.g., true/false, spam/ham, cat/dog).

  - Logistic Regression (binary or multi-class)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  - Neural Networks

- **Regression**: Predict a continuous value (e.g., price, temperature, age).

  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Neural Networks (e.g., Multilayer Perceptron)

## Unsupervised Learning

You don't have the output column and you train the model without it.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features while preserving important information.

  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

- **Density Estimation**: Estimate the probability distribution of data.

  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  - Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

- **Market Basket Analysis**: Identify associations between items.

  - Apriori Algorithm
  - Eclat Algorithm

- **Clustering**: Group similar data points together.

  - K-Means
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
  - Mean Shift

# Metrics

## Summary:

- **Accuracy** gives an overall measure of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix** breaks down the types of correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Recall** (or sensitivity) focuses on correctly identifying positive cases.
- **Specificity** (or true negative rate) focuses on correctly identifying negative cases.
- **F1 Score** balances precision and recall into a single metric, useful when there's an uneven class distribution.
